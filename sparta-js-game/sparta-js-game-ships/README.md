# JavaScript Game Sprint 1

Ships Game was inspired by the 1978 arcade game, Space Invaders.
Initial game planning, wireframing and pseudocode was produced to replicate the original space invaders game, including shooting mechanisms. 
Due to time constraints, the game was adapted to produce a MVP with a variation to game play, to include 'ship-breakout' to score.

## Future Sprint

Currently implementing sprint 2 of the game to include the following capabilities and variations:
* shooting mechanisms and animation to replicate the original space invaders game
* game levels
* multi-player
* leaderboard with local storage of player scores
